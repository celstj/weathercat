# Weather Cat App 🌦️🐾 
Weather Cat is an interactive weather app that shows current and hourly weather conditions, with a cute cat mascot that changes according to the weather! You can search for locations, and watch the weather evolve over the hours while the mascot keeps you company. 🌈

---

## Features
- Location-based weather: Automatically fetches your location using your IP address, or you can manually search for a location.

- Hourly and daily forecasts: View weather for the upcoming hours or forecasted days with detailed weather data (temperature, wind, humidity, etc.).

- Mascot changes: A cute weather cat mascot that dynamically changes its appearance based on the weather conditions (using a weather condition code).

- Time & Date: Displays the current time & date, along with the time and date for selected hours and days.

## Technologies Used
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Weather API: fetch weather data details.
- IP Location API: get user's location by IP for default weather data retrieval.
- S3 Bucket: uploaded img/gif for dynamic mascots.
- mongoDB: link between S3 bucket to website.
- Vercel Hosting

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repo:**
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/celstj/WeatherCat.git 
cd weather-cat-app
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up your `.env` file with your API keys:**
```bash
VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your-weather-api-key
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri

```

4. **Run the App:**
```bash
npm start
```

## How It Works
1. Location Handling:
The app first attempts to fetch your location by IP address. If it fails, you can search for a location manually.

useLocationByIP fetches the location using an IP location service.

2. Weather Data:
The app fetches weather data using the Weather API, showing current and forecasted conditions.
[Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/)

It handles hourly and daily data, and updates the UI with the weather info based on the selected hour or day.

3. Mascot Image:
The mascot changes depending on the weather code (like sunny, rainy, or cloudy), fetched using `useFetchCatMascot`.

- The weather code is sent to the `/api/getImageKey` function which queries MongoDB for the correct S3 image key.
- Then, it redirects to `/api/mascotRedirect` to fetch the image from S3.
- This two-step process helps avoid Vercel timeouts by separating logic and image streaming.

## Challenges
- using React for the first time and navigating through the useStates, useEffect, useMemo etc.
- **API requests and server-side logic:**  
    configured server-side code to handle API requests, fetch images from S3 based on weather codes, and return the image.
    remembered that mongoDB has the imageURL for S3 images directly.
- **MongoDB, S3 and frontend integration:**
    had difficulties connecting to MongoDB and S3 to the frontend, ensuring images were fetched from S3 based on weather condition codes.
- keeping track of the dynamic changes according to weather and hour, and making sure that the details are changed in real time.
- hourly slider not bleeding into the next day as expected when the slots aren't filled.
- weatherData.current.condition.text not being shown as expected, fixed by removing the 'text' from weatherData.current.condition
-restructured server functions to split MongoDB logic and S3 image fetching to avoid Vercel 504 errors, and reworked how mascot images are served using redirect handler

## Self-Deployment Notes

- For local testing, API routes (under `/api/`) can be accessed via `npm run dev`. (doesn't load mascot image, hence the switch to `npx vercel dev`)
- If using Vercel for deployment, **no need to define functions manually in `vercel.json`** unless doing advanced routing — Vercel auto-detects your `/api` folder.
- Edge Functions might introduce **cold start latency**, especially on first load. In production, it stabilizes a bit better.


## Known Issues / TODO
- `Current Working` on optimizing mobile responsiveness, layout will adapt across devices by August 2025.
- latency/performance check for seamless img load feedback

**Potential improvements Ideas:**
- replace all the `current api` to `forecast api` as forecast api also includes current weather data, and it'll make data retrieving more streamline
- optimise as OBS overlay module.
- dark & light mode theme.
